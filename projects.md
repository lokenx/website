##Plex Requests
####"Simple automated way for users to request new content for Plex."

I'm currently the developer behind the application [Plex Requests](http://plexrequests.8bits.ca). For those who are running [Plex](http://plex.tv) servers, it's a web application that you can run that gives your users easy access to make requests for things to be added to the server. You can find more information about it on [GitHub](https://github.com/lokenx/plexrequests-meteor), or visit the project's [website](http://plexrequests.8bits.ca/)!

  
##Cisco Learning
####"Learning through creation."
On my quest to complete the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam, I've decided to supplement my normal notes with a few web pages. I'll use them to represent various aspects I'll be studying, as well as to try out new CSS or JS ideas I have. It may even give me motivation to study. You can view the collection of pages [here](http://cisco.8bits.ca)!
