        <h2>Installing Plex Requests on Windows</h2>

        <div class="published-date">12 April 2015 &nbsp; • &nbsp; <a class="tag" href="/tag/guide.html">guide</a></div>

        <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or those currently using Windows for running <a href="http://plexrequests.8bits.ca">Plex Requests</a> it can seem a bit intimidating to get things up and running, not to mention updating to new versions! I hope to give a quick rundown on how to do things using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> which allows you to update and switch branches the easiest.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>The only requirement is Git which you can download and install from <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>. The standard installation options should suffice as we’re going to be using the GUI component that is installed. I was going to use the <code>bash</code> version but it seems you can’t copy or paste into it which is silly.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I somehow missed an important step in the installation process: actually installing Meteor! If you don’t already have Meteor installed, head over to <a href="https://www.meteor.com/install">https://www.meteor.com/install</a> to get the Windows installer. Download and then run the installer. Once that’s complete Meteor should be installed and ready to go! To confirm, open up a command prompt, and type <code>meteor --version</code>.</p>
<p>Once the installation is complete of Git and Meteor, open up <code>Git GUI</code> from your start menu. From the options listed, select <code>Clone Existing Repository</code>. For the source enter the clone URL for the project, <code>https://github.com/lokenx/plexrequests-meteor.git</code>. For the target location, choose the folder you would like to install Plex Requests into, from here on out we’ll be using <code>C:\plexrequests</code>. Then press Clone to start the download process.</p>
<p>You should now have the folder you specified with the project files downloaded into. You can open up your command prompt, navigate to the folder, and run <code>meteor</code> to get Plex Requests running locally at <code>http://locahost:3000/</code>. Your database is saved in <code>C:\plexrequests\.meteor\local</code> if you want to make backup copies of it. You can also safely close the <code>Git GUI</code> application as it’s not needed to be open all the time.</p>
<h3 id="updating">Updating</h3>
<p>When a new version comes out, a bug release is pushed, or you just want to update to the latest copy it’s super simple. Stop the <code>meteor</code> process from the command line with <code>ctrl + c</code>. Open up <code>Git GUI</code> and from the main screen you should see the repository we made earlier. If not, select <code>Open Existing Repository</code> and point it towards the folder where Plex Requests is installed. In the new window select the <code>Remote</code> menu, highlight the <code>Fetch</code> option and select <code>origin</code>. A new window should open that shows you the progress and status of any updates that have been applied, and once complete show <code>Success</code>. If that’s the case you’re all done, Plex Requests is now updated to the latest version!</p>
<h3 id="switching-to-dev">Switching to dev</h3>
<p>If you feel adventurous, or want to try out some new feature that’s currently under development you can easily switch to the dev branch. Using <code>Git GUI</code> open up your current repository as we did earlier. Select the <code>Branch</code> menu and then select <code>Create</code>. In the new window choose <code>Match Tracking Branch Name</code> at the top. In the next section select the branch you want to switch to, be it <code>dev</code> or <code>master</code> (if you want to switch back to the main releases). After a few moments the window should close and the main Git screen should say <code>Checked out</code> whichever repository you selected in the lower left. You’re now running on the latest release of the branch you selected.</p>
<p>Hopefully you now have Plex Requests up and running on your machine locally, as well as have the ability to easily update it as new versions get released.
